            <span class="t">T</span>his happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling. About twelve
            o'clock a troop of ten or
            twelve thousand <br> head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its speed, tried to
            clear the way with its cowâ€“catcher; but <br>
            the mass of animals was too great. The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait, uttering now and then
            deafening <br>bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction,
            nothing can moderate and change their <br>
            course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain. <br>
        </p> <br>

        <p class="text text2"> The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas Fogg, who
            had the most reason of all to be in a hurry, <br>
            remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it
            should please the buffaloes to get out of the way. <br>
            Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of revolvers upon
            them.</p> <br>
        <br>
        <p class="text text3">"What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a procession, just
            as if they were not impeding travel! Parbleu! <br>
            I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his programme! And here's an engineer who doesn't
            dare to run the locomotive <br>
            into this herd of beasts!" <br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="text text4">&#8220; The engineer did not try to overcome the obstacle,
            and he
            was wise.</p>
