            Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time... like tears <br>
            in rain... <span class="die"> Time to die.</span></p>

            loved life more than he ever had before. Not just his life - anybody's <br>
            life; my life. All he'd wanted were the same answers...</p>
